# Closed Loop Voltage Regulation Project
This project involves the closed-loop control of a power electronic converter to regulate bus voltage for battery storage.

The converter is a boost converter, controlled by a Altera Cyclone FPGA programmed in Verilog. Full details can be found in the document "ClosedLoop_VoltageRegulator_Project_Report.pdf".
